# Foldkart - Flipkart Clone Project

I developed a Flipkart Project utilising ReactJS for the front end, NodeJS and ExpressJS for the back end, and MongoDB for the database. In order to provide more features, other libraries like as Redux, Material UI, axios, and others are also used.

**Frontend:** ReactJS , Redux, MaterialUI
**Backend**: MongoDB , ExpressJS , NodeJS
